Preparing Data for a Public Health Organization

This project focuses on preparing and cleaning data for use by a public health organization, with an emphasis on exploratory data analysis (EDA), multivariate analysis, and data visualization. I've learned how to clean and preprocess data, conduct univariate and multivariate statistical analysis to explore relationships between variables, and present my  findings with compelling visualizations to support decision-making in the public health domain.
 
Key Skills Acquired:

    Data Cleaning: Identifying and handling missing data, correcting inconsistencies, and transforming raw data into a format suitable for analysis. You will also deal with outliers and duplicates to ensure data quality.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting univariate and multivariate analysis to understand data distributions and relationships between variables. This is key to uncovering insights from complex datasets.
    Multivariate Analysis: Analyzing the interactions between multiple variables to uncover patterns and correlations that can inform public health strategies.
    Data Visualization: Using Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) to create clear and informative visualizations that make your findings accessible and easy to interpret.
    Statistical Analysis: Applying statistical techniques to summarize and interpret data, including hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and regression models.
    Decision Justification: Learning to draw actionable conclusions from data and presenting them in a way that supports decision-making in a public health context.

Technologies Used:

    Python: The main programming language for data analysis, cleaning, and visualization.
    Pandas & NumPy: Libraries for data manipulation and cleaning, working with structured data.
    Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly: Visualization libraries for creating charts, graphs, and interactive plots to present data insights.
    SciPy / Statsmodels: For conducting statistical tests, regression analysis, and hypothesis testing.
    Jupyter Notebooks: The environment used for documenting and sharing your analysis, including code and visualizations.
